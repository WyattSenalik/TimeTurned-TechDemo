// Naming Conventions and my reasons for the ones in here:
// Want to make all names different to easy tell scope
// and what it is (function/member variable/property)

// ClassName - PascalCase to match C# standards.
// Interfaces - Prefixed with an I to match C# standards.
// CONSTANTS - Standard Capitalization.
// Functions() - PascalCase to match C# standards.
// memberProperties - LowerCamelCase to match Unity's property naming conventions (ex: transform, gameObject).
//      I'm unsure if this is best thing for properties because we like to make temp variables and parameters
//      with this same naming convention in functions and such.
// m_privateMemberVariables - Underscore lowerCamelCase to tell these are private members.
// s_staticVariables - s_ and lowerCamelCase to tell these are private static variables.
// t_temporaryVariables - t_ and lowerCamelCase to tell these are temporary variables that
//      exist only in the scope of the funciton.
